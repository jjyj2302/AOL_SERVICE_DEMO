{"malware_family":"Android Malware","malware_type":"trojan","behavioral_profile":"The malware primarily operates through Android APK files, leveraging obfuscation and reflection techniques to evade detection. It is designed to connect to various Command and Control (C2) servers for executing commands and exfiltrating data.","infrastructure_usage_patterns":"The malware actively communicates with resolved IPs associated with the malicious domain. It uses these IPs for C2 communication and data exfiltration while interacting with other compromised infrastructures.","communication_mechanisms":["HTTP","HTTPS","WebSocket"],"attack_chain_analysis":"The attack lifecycle starts with the delivery of malicious APKs which, once installed, establish a connection to C2 servers. They then execute payloads to gather information and possibly perform additional malicious actions based on commands from the server.","payload_delivery_methods":["APK distribution via compromised websites","Social engineering for installations"],"infrastructure_targets":[{"target_type":"c2_ip","target":"91.195.240.12","behavioral_context":"Used as a primary C2 server for command execution and data exfiltration.","priority":"HIGH"},{"target_type":"c2_domain","target":"site111.mallmaster.top","behavioral_context":"Acts as the main distribution domain for the malicious APKs and as a relay for the C2 communications.","priority":"HIGH"}],"parent_child_relationships":["classes.dex -> APK files"],"contextual_analysis":"The behavioral analysis reveals a direct connection between the identified APKs and the malicious domain, indicating a cohesive operation designed for widespread impact on the Android ecosystem.","correlation_recommendations":["Investigate other domains associated with the resolved IPs for potential campaign mapping","Analyze related APK files for further insights into the malware family and variants"]}
